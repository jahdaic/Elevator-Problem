# Elevator Problem

## Details
* 10 Story Building
* 3 Elevators

## Task
Build a program to control the actions of elevators inside of a building.

Also build a very simple display that shows the 3 elevators within that building, animating the position of the elevators in real-time with CSS. The display can be as simple as rectangles (elevators) moving up and down inside of a larger rectangle (building).

## Constraints
You must use pure JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 only.

An empty elevator can go up or down, but an elevator with passengers must continue in its current direction, stopping at all floors requested before it reverses direction.

The program needs to have a central data store that holds the state of each elevator as well as any data necessary for the program.

You must make use of callback functions or promises.

## Testing
* Basic HTML and CSS - Was the display created efficiently with minimal HTML and CSS
* JavaScript - Was the Javascript properly written, did they use consistent code style and did the make any logic errors
* Data structures - Was the structure of the data store efficient
* DRY coding practices (objects) - Was the code for the 3 elevators duplicated or was it inherited, did they use objects or functions
* Callback functions - Were the callback functions for the elevator and buttons implemented correctly were proper triggers used
* CSS Animations - Was the display animated properly with CSS animations
